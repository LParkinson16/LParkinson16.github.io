<h2>A little bit about me</h2>
<p>
Hi, my name's Latiff and this is a little about me.
<br>
I am a confident, hardworking and enthusiastic sixth form graduate at <br>
Ada. National College for Digital Skills 
and have also completed a six week course in 
software engineering and employability with Generation UK. 
<br>
<br>
These experiences have equipped me with certain skills as follows:
<br>
I am also a very strong communicator, 
able to express myself with firm engaging techniques and very good listening skills. An experienced project 
manager who is sociable, and works extremely well in teams gaining experience in customer service job roles. 
I am a natural born leader with the ability and experience to work well under pressure, persistent and 
dedicated to achieving all set targets. I am also I.T. literate in Microsoft packages such as Word, Excel, 
Power point, as well as being fluent in Adobe suite applications such as Photoshop and Illustrator. 
Attending ADA has given me an insight into the rigorous work ethic required for working in an industry 
setting through the various projects that I have taken part in involving industry partners where we work 
in a simulated workplace environment.

<h2>A constantly evolving website</h2>
<p>
I made this website not just to show off to employers but also as a means of gauging how far I've come and how 
much I've learned every time i return to update it. I first began making this site around August 2019 having 
little to no knowledge on how to use HTML and since then it's seen many many stages of development. Just 
about all of my insight on how to build websites was at first self taught through resources like the Coding for dummies 
series (thanks mum!) W3Schools or just old fashioned trial and error, however since then I've completed 
a six week course in software Engineering and employability as part of the Tech Talent Accelerator with
Generation Uk I'm always seeking to do better so my 
work is never done and there's always room for improvement, and that's fine with me.
